 I didn't simplify the fractions, where a note is an octave higher I just doubled the right hand side, where it's an octave lower I doubled the left; sorry.
Sometimes instead of finding the just interval you're looking for there will be a more complex equivelant, but only in higher and lower octaves. 

i.e there's no 3_1.wav 3:1 just interval it's called 6:2 instead.

I know I should've simplified the filenames but it would've made the code messier. 
I promise will simplify all fractions in the next version and hopefully by then I will have  the keybord supporting chords.
For now, playing note cancels the previou note, I'm sorry, I'm still porting this from an old linux script and I don't fully get winsound.
Once implemented through the pygame mixer it will be cross platform.
As you can see I've started towards it, that's why there's messy functions that aren't doing anything yet
