Update:
Added chord suport! 
Now using pygame mixer with 8 channels
No longer winsound dependent

I didn't simplify the fractions, where a note is an octave higher I just doubled the right hand side, where it's an octave lower I doubled the left; sorry.
Sometimes instead of finding the just interval you're looking for there will be a more complex equivelant, but only in higher and lower octaves. 

i.e there's no 3_1.wav 3:1 just interval it's called 6:2 instead.

I know I should've simplified the filenames but it would've made the code messier. 
I promise will simplify all fractions in the next version
